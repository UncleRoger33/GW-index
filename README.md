These are all sets i have :)

I'm looking on the bright side of this COVID and self isolation. It gives an opportunity to work on some side projects like this one.

I'm going to do some extra work on this page and make it a proper index for the awesome "Galitsin Works A-Z (1999-2020)" thread. That thread deserves that!

To-Do list
First of all (hard part):
- Add covers of sets
- Link sets to the relevant post #

After this is done (easy part):
- Make a model index
- List their sets

Also i'm open to other suggestions.
